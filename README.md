## ðŸš© Challenge 1: Non-Fungible Token - iOS/iPadOS

ðŸŽ« Deploy your own NFT contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:

- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts.
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Swift iOS/iPadOS app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

ðŸŒŸ The final deliverable is a Mobile DApp that lets users create an empty collection, mint some pre-loaded NFTs, and transfer them to another account on Flow testnet.
